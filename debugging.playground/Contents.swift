//: ## Q1: Optionals
//: The compiler is yelling at us. Why isn't this the correct way to unwrap optionals?

class Foo {
    
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (words: [String?]) {
        wordA = words[0]
        wordB = words[1]
    }
    
//: '?' doesn't unwrap an optional. When wordA and wordB are defined, they are given type 'String!' so the values are implicitly unwrapped when they are assigned and we don't need to forcefully unwrap them.
    
    
    
//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
//: Why does the compiler dislike the for loop? Also, what should we return?
    
    class func arePalindromes(words: [String]) -> Bool! {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reverse())}
        let numElements = words.count

                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
    
//: The 'let i' makes 'i' an constant so the complier can't increment it at each iteration of the loop. We should return true instead of nil. The function needs to be denoted as a method of the Foo class by adding 'class' before 'func'
    
    
    
//: ## Q3: More functions, and object initialization
//: The method should be returning true or false -- what's wrong?
//: Are we initializing the dictionary correctly?
    class func isAnagram(wordA: String, wordB: String) -> Bool {
        var countLetters = [Character : Int]()
        let lenA = wordA.characters.count
        let lenB = wordB.characters.count

            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }

                countLetters[letter] = val - 1

                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (_, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false

//: The method header says that it returns an optional bool, when it should be non-optional and the function should return true instead of nil. The dictionary was not initialized because there was no initializer call. The function needs to be denoted as a method of the Foo class by adding 'class' before 'func'


//: **Do not** change anything below.
//: You should be able to call the methods as is.
